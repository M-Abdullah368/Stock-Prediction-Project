# Stock-Prediction-Project
Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using  LSTM
In this project we are going to do univariate method of analysis. We'll use only the close parameter of the data to predict th
next data. We are going to apply RNN recurrent neural network or LSTM (Long short term memory) which is very useful for
for the time series analysis. We are going to find the pattern for the close price of the data
